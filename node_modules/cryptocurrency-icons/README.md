# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 2000 icons ‚Äì [318 crypto, and fiat currencies](https://github.com/cjdowner/cryptocurrency-icons/blob/master/Coin%20List.md), in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All I ask is that you don‚Äôt claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in 32√ó32, 64√ó64(@2x), and 128√ó128 variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you‚Äôre looking for that hasn‚Äôt been included, please create a new issue and I shall include it.

## Building üõ†

The build system requires node and npm to be installed on your system.  After they are installed you can install the npm dependencies with

    npm install

You can then build with

    npm run build
