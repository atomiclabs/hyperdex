		"description": " <0>HyperDEX is a decentralized exchange. It has a P2P order book and trades are made via <1>cross-chain atomic swaps</1>. This means it works slightly differently than a centralized exchange.</0><1>Orders can take a while to propagate across the P2P network. You may need to wait a while for the order book to display.</1><2>HyperDEX needs you to have correctly sized <1>UTXOs</1> to make a successful swap. For each UTXO you can make a single swap. The easiest way to ensure you can participate in a swap is to make two or three smaller deposits to your account rather than a single large deposit.</2><3>An atomic swap is comprised of six on-chain transactions. When trading a currency with high transaction fees, it's important to slightly increase your price to account for the total transaction fees. This is especially important when trading small amounts.</3>",
