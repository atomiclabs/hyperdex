					<p>HyperDEX is a decentralized exchange. It has a P2P order book and trades are made via <ExternalLink url="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading">cross-chain atomic swaps</ExternalLink>. This means it works slightly differently than a centralized exchange.</p>
					<p>Orders can take a while to propagate across the P2P network. You may need to wait a while for the order book to display.</p>
					<p>HyperDEX needs you to have correctly sized <ExternalLink url="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/61579">UTXOs</ExternalLink> to make a successful swap. For each UTXO you can make a single swap. The easiest way to ensure you can participate in a swap is to make two or three smaller deposits to your account rather than a single large deposit.</p>
					<p>An atomic swap is comprised of six on-chain transactions. When trading a currency with high transaction fees, it&apos;s important to slightly increase your price to account for the total transaction fees. This is especially important when trading small amounts.</p>
