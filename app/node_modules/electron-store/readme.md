# electron-store [![Build Status: Linux and macOS](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/electron-store.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/electron-store) [![Build status: Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/m2m9o6gq77xxi2eg/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sindresorhus/electron-store/branch/master)

> Simple data persistence for your [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) app or module - Save and load user preferences, app state, cache, etc

Electron doesn't have a built-in way to persist user preferences and other data. This module handles that for you, so you can focus on building your app. The data is saved in a JSON file in [`app.getPath('userData')`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname).

You can use this module directly in both the main and renderer process.

*[This project was recently renamed from `electron-config`.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store/issues/4)*


## Install

```
$ npm install electron-store
```


## Usage

```js
const Store = require('electron-store');
const store = new Store();

store.set('unicorn', 'ðŸ¦„');
console.log(store.get('unicorn'));
//=> 'ðŸ¦„'

// Use dot-notation to access nested properties
store.set('foo.bar', true);
console.log(store.get('foo'));
//=> {bar: true}

store.delete('unicorn');
console.log(store.get('unicorn'));
//=> undefined
```


## API

Changes are written to disk atomically, so if the process crashes during a write, it will not corrupt the existing config.

### Store([options])

Returns a new instance.

### options

#### defaults

Type: `Object`

Default data.

#### name

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `config`

Name of the storage file (without extension).

This is useful if you want multiple storage files for your app. Or if you're making a reusable Electron module that persists some data, in which case you should **not** use the name `config`.

#### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: [`app.getPath('userData')`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname)

Storage file location. *Don't specify this unless absolutely necessary!*

If a relative path, it's relative to the default cwd. For example, `{cwd: 'unicorn'}` would result in a storage file in `~/Library/Application Support/App Name/unicorn`.

#### encryptionKey

Type: `string` `Buffer` `TypedArray` `DataView`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Note that this is **not intended for security purposes**, since the encryption key would be easily found inside a plain-text Electron app.

Its main use is for obscurity. If a user looks through the config directory and finds the config file, since it's just a JSON file, they may be tempted to modify it. By providing an encryption key, the file will be obfuscated, which should hopefully deter any users from doing so.

It also has the added bonus of ensuring the config file's integrity. If the file is changed in any way, the decryption will not work, in which case the store will just reset back to its default state.

When specified, the store will be encrypted using the [`aes-256-cbc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) encryption algorithm.

### Instance

You can use [dot-notation](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop) in a `key` to access nested properties.

The instance is [`iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) so you can use it directly in a [`forâ€¦of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop.

#### .set(key, value)

Set an item.

#### .set(object)

Set multiple items at once.

#### .get(key, [defaultValue])

Get an item or `defaultValue` if the item does not exist.

#### .has(key)

Check if an item exists.

#### .delete(key)

Delete an item.

#### .clear()

Delete all items.

#### .onDidChange(key, callback)

`callback`: `(newValue, oldValue) => {}`

Watches the given `key`, calling `callback` on any changes. When a key is first set `oldValue` will be `undefined`, and when a key is deleted `newValue` will be `undefined`.

#### .size

Get the item count.

#### .store

Get all the data as an object or replace the current data with an object:

```js
conf.store = {
	hello: 'world'
};
```

#### .path

Get the path to the storage file.

#### .openInEditor()

Open the storage file in the user's editor.
